# Simple 3D Computational Geometry

SCG is a simple, value oriented, MIT License library for 3D computational geometry in C++11.

## Data Structures

* 3D points
* Planes
* Triangles
* Triangular meshes
* Rrotations and homogeneous transformations
* Height fields
* Voxel volumes

SCG also has a built in binary STL file parser to load data in to triangular meshes.

## Dependecies
* boost
